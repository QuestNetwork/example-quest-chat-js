## Description

Quest Chat JS is the first fully featured, publicly auditable decentralized, end-to-end encrypted messenger to rival all the other chat apps. It makes use of the [Interplanetary Filesystem](https://ipfs.io), as well as of the [Quest Network PubSub Protocol](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-pubsub-js) and the Quest Network Whistle ID Protocol among other dependencies. We're planning to integrate payments soon, so you can send each other money!

Quest Chat JS works in the browser, as an Electron on Windows, Mac and Linux and as a Chromium on iOS and Android.

## Installation & Usage

Please use our [quest-cli](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-cli) to test and build the app.

Pro Tip: Put a file in your `/bin` that runs the quest-cli like so `node /path/to/quest-cli/index.js` from any folder on your system. It's much nicer!
