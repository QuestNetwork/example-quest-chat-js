## qDesk Messages

![Screenshot](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qd-messages-ts/raw/0.9.3/doc/images/0.9.3.png?raw=true)

## Description

qDesk Messages is on track to become the first fully featured, cross-platform, publicly auditable, decentralized, real-time, dag based end-to-end encrypted messenger with a feature to exchange goods and services and send payments. The messenger is a module for [qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk) and it's built on [Quest OS](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-os-js) which makes use of the [Interplanetary Filesystem](https://ipfs.io), [IPFS GossipSub](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-05-20-gossipsub-v1.1/) and [qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk), our window platform based on [Angular10](https://angular.io/).

We have chosen Angular/Electron as an example environment because we believe it offers the best accessibility for developers coming from any other language/framework. It is already being used in Python on PyQt5 and we aim to provide the underlying library in Go and wherever possible in Rust as well. 

We're planning to become for messaging what [Atom](https://atom.io) is for writing code.

Full IRC & Matrix integration is planned as well.

[qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk) works in the browser, as an Electron on Windows, Mac and Linux and Android using Cordova.

**Note**: Things are still a little sloppy here and there, if you think something doesn't work, give it 20s.

## Security

[Quest OS](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-os-js) uses [4096 Bit RSA-OAEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Operation) encryption, [256 Bit AES-CBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) encryption and [NIST P-521 EC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography#Fast_reduction_(NIST_curves)) signatures.

If you want anything else, you'll have to build from sources and probably fix some stuff.

## Development

### Planning 

See our [Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/QuestNetwork/projects/1) for the development of 0.9.5, feel free to add or pick up features!

### Building

qDesk Messenger is a module of [qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk), so please see https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk#development for instructions.

### Commands

**Prepare Package**

``npm run inst`` Removes `package-lock.json` and runs ``npm install``

We added an example ```swarm.json``` to the ```src/app``` folder with an example node to make reproduction easier, but we strongly recommend to use our [Quest CLI](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-cli) to test and build the app.

Pro Tip: Put a file in your `/bin` that runs the quest-cli like so `node /path/to/quest-cli/index.js` from any folder on your system. It's much nicer!
